# Complex Network Characteristics Analysis
Analyzing random graph characteristics including average node degree, degree count, and degree change during cycles after applying an initial fitness to each node. These graphs represent an abstract overview of relationships in social media applications like facebook, instagram, and etc.

In this particular example, It shows a graph with 50 nodes and each one connecting to 5 other nodes. In each cycle, nodes with higher fitness and higher degree count, gain more connections from others. This is similar to what's happening in social media applications, individuals with higher number of followers and popularity gain more followers daily. On the other hand, personal accounts and people who has less popularity will remain the same or relatively unchanged.
