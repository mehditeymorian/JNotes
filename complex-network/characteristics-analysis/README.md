# Complex Network Characteristics Analysis
Analyzing random graph characteristics like average node degree, degree count, degree change during cycles after applying a fitness to each node.

Here for example is a result of 50 nodes and each connecting to 5 other nodes, swaping edge between nodes in favor of nodes with higher degree and fitness.
